Hello, this blog is mainly for recording the development of LESS system. LESS is designed for radiometric simulation of 3D landscapes, one of the main applications is validating some inversion algorithms in remote sensing. 
LESS is based on a ray tracer (http://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/), which is a research-oriented rendering system.
Currently, LESS can simulate BRF images, upwelling and downwelling radiations and also fisheye images with different projection. More features will be added in the future.
