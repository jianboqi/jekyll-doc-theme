            <blockquote>
              <p>LESS is a ray-tracing based radiative transfer simulation model, which is mainly designed for radiometric simulation of forest canopies, but also can simulate other kinds of scenes (such as cities etc.). A possible advantage of LESS is that it can simulate relatively large areas with millions of single trees, thus we named it as Large-scale Emulation System for forest Simulation (LESS). Through parallel computing, LESS can run on high-performance computing clusters （e.g. > 1000 cores). It can also combine some common computers into a parallel computing cluster in a fast and simple way, which greatly increases the usability of LESS when we do not have access to high-performance clusters. LESS is developed with Java, Python and C++.</p>
