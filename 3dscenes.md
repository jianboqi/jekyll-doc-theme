### LESS projects from RAMI scenes
This section provides all the LESS simulations that are built from RAMI scenes.
#### For ROMC ([RAMI On-Line Model Checker](http://romc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/WWW/PAGES/ROMC_Model/ROMC_Model_Menu.php))
#### Validation Mode
  Currently, the Validation mode of ROMC only provides a limited number of scenes for evaluating models.The LESS simulations of this two scene can be download from here: [HET01_DIS_UNI](https://github.com/jianboqi/lessrt/releases/download/1.0/HET01_DIS_UNI.zip)  , [HOM11_DIS_ERE](https://github.com/jianboqi/lessrt/releases/download/1.0/HOM11_DIS_ERE.zip). 
  When doing simulation, please modify the sun zenith angle according to different requirements of ROMC. These two simulations only simulates total BRF in principle and orthgraphic plane.
#### Debug Mode
The LESS simulations of all the RAMI3 scenes (facet mode) in the Debug Mode of ROMC can be download here: [LESS simulations for RAMI3](https://github.com/jianboqi/lessrt/releases/download/1.0/ForRAMI3DebugModeSimulatons.zip)
